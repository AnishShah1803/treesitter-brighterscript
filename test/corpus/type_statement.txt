(source_file
  (type_statement
    (type)
    name: (identifier
      (regular_identifier))
    type: (type_union

type Mixed = string or integer or boolean

---

(source_file

    (type)
    name: (identifier
      (regular_identifier))
    type: (type_union
      (or)
      (or))))

==================
Type union with class types
==================

type Result = MyClass or OtherClass

---

(source_file
  (type_statement
    (type)
    name: (identifier
      (regular_identifier))
    type: (type_union
      (dotted_identifier
        (identifier
          (regular_identifier)))
      (or)
      (dotted_identifier
        (identifier
